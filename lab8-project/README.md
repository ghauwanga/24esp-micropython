# Project

## Instructions

*The goal of this project is for small teams of 3-4 students to explore a chosen topic, use the [labs's components](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/esp-micropython?tab=readme-ov-file#components-and-tools), develop solutions, simulate and implement them, create documentation, and present the results. Team members will organize and divide tasks among themselves.*

* The students will work on the project for four weeks, ending with a presentation and a practical demonstration (simulations alone are not enough), see the course schedule in e-learning.

* The ESP32 code must be written in MicroPython and must be implementable on an ESP32 FireBeetle board.

* If needed, use the simulation tools, such as [wokwi](https://wokwi.com/), [Falstad](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html), etc.

* Draw illustrative flowcharts for all important functions/interrupt routines.

* Design a block diagram or circuit diagram of your application (EasyEDA, KiCAD, Eagle, ...).

* Optionally, design a PCB and/or 3D-printable enclosure for your solution.

* Use modules from the labs. Create own modules (and documentation) for the new components.

* Follow coding standards in your codes.

* Strictly follow licenses for third-party libraries !

* Create a public [GitHub](https://github.com/) (or other online software development platform) repository for your project and publish all files here.

* Provide a list of all tools used during the project, including Machine Learning (some are listed [here](https://github.com/tomas-fryza/esp-micropython/wiki)).

* A PowerPoint-style presentation is not required; a good README on GitHub is sufficient.

* During the presentation, you can play a short video (max 1 minute) with subtitles or explanatory captions.

### BPA-DE2 topics 2024/25

**Measurement/Control/Visualization of the environment for tropical plants**
The goal of the project would be to create a system that measures key environmental parameters (such as temperature, humidity, light levels, soil moisture) for tropical plants. This system should also allow the user to control or adjust environmental conditions and visualize the data.

Inspiration: [Climate Chamber System](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/ms_peach/climate-chamber-system-c545de)

**GPS tracker**
*Max 2 teams.*
GPS-based environmental sensor data logger. The system integrates GPS functionality for location tracking and environment sensor(s) to capture data related to environmental conditions. The project aims to log and display sensor data and provide the capability to export the collected information for analysis.

**Digital clock**
*Max 2 teams.*
Design and implement a digital clock using [NeoPixel displays](https://www.vokolo.cz/rubriky/navody/navod-na-stavbu-hodin-neopixsegment/). The clock will not only display the current time but will also include additional features such as alarms and synchronization with network time servers.

**ESP-NOW mesh network with ESP32**
Design and implement a wireless mesh network using ESP32 microcontrollers and MicroPython, utilizing the ESP-NOW protocol. The goal is to create a decentralized network where ESP32 nodes can communicate with each other wirelessly, enabling data exchange and collaboration.
