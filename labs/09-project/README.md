# Project

### MPA-DIE topic

Complete the free online course at coursera.org by Edge Impulse [Introduction to Embedded Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-embedded-machine-learning)

Solve a machine learning project using ESP32 or your Smart phone and [Edge Impulse tool](https://edgeimpulse.com/).

### BPA-DE2 topics

*Topics will be presented one week before the project starts.*

**Digital clock**
*Max 2 groups.*
Design and implement a digital clock using the MicroPython programming language on the ESP32 microcontroller. The clock will not only display the current time in both decimal and binary formats but will also include additional features such as alarms and synchronization with network time servers.

**ESP-NOW mesh network with ESP32**
*Max 2 groups.*
Design and implement a wireless mesh network using ESP32 microcontrollers and MicroPython, utilizing the ESP-NOW protocol. The goal is to create a decentralized network where ESP32 nodes can communicate with each other wirelessly, enabling data exchange and collaboration.

**ESP32 weather station with forecast**
*Max 2 groups.*
Create a weather station using ESP32 microcontrollers, various sensors, and MicroPython. The project aims to collect real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, light level, and display the information on a screen. Log and export the sensor data. Additionally, integrate a weather forecasting feature (see https://peppe8o.com/raspberry-pi-pico-weather-monitor/) to enhance the station's functionality.

**Smart plant watering system and data logger**
*Max 2 groups.*
Propose and develop an intelligent plant watering system using soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, a relay, and a Microcontroller Unit (MCU). The project should aim to automate the plant watering process based on soil moisture conditions, provide visual feedback, record and export data logs, and incorporate a notification feature for relevant updates.

## Instructions

The objective of this group project is to collaborate within small teams (3-4 students), explore a chosen topic, develop innovative solutions, simulate and execute these solutions, generate project documentation, and present the final outcomes. Team members are responsible for organizing and assigning roles and tasks among themselves.

* Students will work on a project **in the labs** during the 9th to 11th weeks of the semester, with the practical demonstration scheduled for the 12th week.

* Using BUT e-learning, students should submit a link to the GitHub repository containing the source codes, required images, documents, and a descriptive README file. **The submission deadline is the day before the demonstration.**

* The ESP32 code must be written in MicroPython and must be implementable on an ESP32 FireBeetle board.

* Create own module for each component.

* Physical implementation is required, not just computer simulation.

* Make a short video of your app demo. (The video can then be used to promote the course.)

## Help:

* Create a block diagram and ciruit diagram (schematic) of your application.

* Optionally design a PCB layout and/or 3D box.

* Draw illustrative flowcharts for all important functions/interrupt routines.

* Strictly follow licenses for third-party libraries !
